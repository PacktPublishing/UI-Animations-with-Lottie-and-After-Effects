Lottie is a small and scalable JSON-based animation file. LottieFiles is the platform where Lottie animations can be uploaded, tested, and shared.

You’ll also see how to use the Bodymovin plugin in After Effects to export your animation to a JSON file.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Get started with Lottie and integrate animations either by creating them from scratch or by downloading them through LottieFiles
* Explore the key principles of 2D classic animation
* Understand the basics to create your first animation using After Effects
* Export your animations into Lottie JSON files through Bodymovin
* Integrate your very first Lottie icon animation inside your React Native app
